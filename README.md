# 2025-Final-Year-Project
Simulation of user migration in a multi-tier HetNet (2G-5G), quantifying how operator incentives (device, bundle, loyalty) shift adoption. Models QoS (rate, latency, coverage) and user heterogeneity, compares baseline vs incentives, and outputs migration rates, adoption changes, and flow heatmaps.
